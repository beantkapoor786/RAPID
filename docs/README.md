[![Shiny](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shiny-1.8%2B-blue.svg)](https://shiny.posit.co/)

RAPID provides complete, code-free graphical interfaces for amplicon sequence analysis using the [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/) pipeline. Two separate applications cover the most widely used marker genes in microbial ecology:

- **16S rRNA app** (`RAPID_16S.R`) - for bacterial and archaeal community profiling (10-step workflow)
- **ITS app** (`RAPID_ITS.R`) - for fungal community profiling (11-step workflow)

Both applications take raw paired-end Illumina FASTQ files as input and produce publication-ready figures, statistical test results, and downloadable data tables - all without writing a single line of code.

### Installation

### Prerequisites

- **R** (version 4.0 or higher) - [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- **RStudio** (recommended) - [Download RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- **cutadapt** (ITS app only) - installed automatically via pip, or [install manually](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository (Terminal on Mac; Powershell on Windows). Ideally, I would clone it into the directory where you are running your R project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beantkapoor786/RAPID.git
```

2. Launch the 16S app (Rstudio):

```r
shiny::runApp("RAPID_16S.R")
```

Or launch the ITS app (Rstudio):

```r
shiny::runApp("RAPID_ITS.R")
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you receive an error related to file opening, please double check that `RAPID_16S.R` and/or `RAPID_ITS.R` exists in your current working directory in R/Rstudio. On first launch, all required R packages will be installed automatically. This may take several minutes.

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you first launch the app, it opens in RStudio, just click **"Open in Browser"** to use it there. The analyses are identical either way, but the browser has one handy perk: it remembers the path you entered, so you won't have to re-enter it every time you resume a session.
> Please remove any index files, control files, blank or undeterminded files before running this pipeline.
> I would make sure the number of samples in the folder match the number of samples in the metadata file. This helps avoid file handling errors.

### Test datasets

Please look at the instructions here to download and analyze [soil 16S test datasets](test_datasets.md)

### Required Packages

The apps automatically install missing packages on startup. The full dependency list:

**CRAN:**
shiny, ggplot2, tidyverse, shinyjs, DT, shinycssloaders, callr, vegan

**Bioconductor:**
dada2, phyloseq, Biostrings, DECIPHER, microbiome, ANCOMBC

**ITS app additionally requires:**
ShortRead (Bioconductor), cutadapt (Python)

## Usage

### Input Data

- **Paired-end FASTQ files** (`.fastq`, `.fastq.gz`, `.fq`, `.fq.gz`)
- Files must be demultiplexed (one pair per sample)
- Forward and reverse reads should follow a naming convention (e.g., `_R1_001.fastq.gz` / `_R2_001.fastq.gz`)

### Metadata File

- **CSV or TSV format**
- First column must contain sample names matching the extracted sample names
- Additional columns are metadata variables (e.g., Treatment, Site, Age)
- Variables are auto-detected as factor or continuous, with manual override
- Handles quoted-row CSVs (common Excel export format) automatically

### Taxonomy Databases

- **16S app:** SILVA v138.1 is downloaded automatically on first use (~130 MB)
- **ITS app:** Provide the path to a [UNITE](https://unite.ut.ee/) reference FASTA file, or point to a directory for auto-download

### Session Persistence

All pipeline state is saved automatically to your data directory after each step. When relaunching the app, you will be offered the option to resume from your last completed step.

### Exports

| Export | Format | Available At |

## Architecture

Both apps share a common architecture:

- **Asynchronous computation** via `callr::r_bg()` background subprocesses - resolves the incompatibility between DADA2's fork-based multiprocessing and Shiny's reactive framework
- **JavaScript-driven instant progress indicators** - animated progress bars appear immediately on button click, before Shiny's reactive flush
- **Reactive session persistence** - auto-saves `.RData` to the data directory after each step
- **Dynamic UI** - metadata variable types, primer inputs, and quality plot sample counts adapt to the data

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't start / package installation fails**
- Ensure R >= 4.0 is installed
- Try installing Bioconductor packages manually:
  ```r
  if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
  BiocManager::install(c("dada2", "phyloseq", "ANCOMBC", "microbiome", "DECIPHER"))
  ```

**Cutadapt not found (ITS app)**
- Install via pip: `pip install cutadapt` or `pip3 install cutadapt`
- Or provide the full path to cutadapt in the app

**Cutadapt produces no output files**
- Check primer sequences match your reads (verify via the primer hit count table)
- Paths with spaces are handled automatically via shell quoting

**Phyloseq construction fails / no sample names match**
- Ensure the first column of your metadata CSV contains sample names matching the extracted sample names shown in Step 1
- The app handles CSVs with quoted rows (common Excel export issue) automatically

**ANCOM-BC2 / PERMANOVA errors about missing variables**
- Both tools validate formula variables before running - check the error notification for the exact variable name and available metadata columns

**Taxonomy step hangs**
- 16S: SILVA database download may take time on first use
- ITS: Ensure the UNITE database path points to an actual `.fasta` file or a directory containing one
